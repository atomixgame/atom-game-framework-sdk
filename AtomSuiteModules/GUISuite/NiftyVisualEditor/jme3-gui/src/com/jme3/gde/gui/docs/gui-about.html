            Visual GUI Editor was created with the intent to simplify the creation of your Nifty, ToneGod, Lemur gui. Loosely inspired a previous Nifty-Editor software brings many new features both in code and functionality. First of all is the ability to save and load your gui in xml files which then can be read by your application using Nifty-Gui library. Moreover, the ease of use will save a lot of time not only in the construction of the gui but also in learning xml syntax used by Nifty-Gui. Indeed the software will translate what you see in your MAINVIEW to a xml file without you know nothing of how Nifty-Gui read the file. For now the software it is only in alpha stage but the main functions are already operating without many bugs. </html>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
